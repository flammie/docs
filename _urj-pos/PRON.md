Pronouns are used for nominals references without intrinsic semantic
value, some pronouns have defective case paradigms but usually resemble nouns
in their paradigms.

Pro-words of other parts of speech than noun are common in Uralic languages, in
the current Universal scheme they are still categorised under the respective
non pro part of speech, i.e., ADJ for pro-adjectives, ADV for pro-adverb and so
forth.
