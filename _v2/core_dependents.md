# Core Dependents in UD v2

The distinction between core dependents and the rest is fundamental to the whole taxonomy.
Having specific and cross-linguistically consistent guidelines for core dependents is therefore
crucial for putting the whole enterprise on a solid footing. This involves clarifying the
treatment of (among other things) double objects, reflexives, expletives, copula constructions
and valency-changing operations.
Relevant reports from the Uppsala meeting includes:
[copula](../2015-08-23-uppsala/copula.html),
[clitics](../2015-08-23-uppsala/clitics.html).

* Joakim's take on valency-changing operations: The current guidelines distinguish [u-dep/nsubjpass](), [u-dep/csubjpass](), and [u-dep/auxpass]() from [u-dep/nsubj](), [u-dep/csubj]() and [u-dep/aux]() to capture the fact that the subject of a passive has a different role than the subject of the corresponding active verb. While I can clearly see the usefulness of this convention for many IE-type practical applications, it seems to go against the general spirit in UD of annotating syntactic functions rather than semantic roles. A possible counterargument would be that passive is a grammaticalized process and therefore part of syntax, but the counter-counterargument to this is that the same should then be true of causative, antipassive, etc. in many languages. First of all, I don't think we want a proliferation of grammatical relations like "dobjcaus", etc. Secondly, I think the lexicalist stance in UD actually speaks in favor of a lexicalist account of these operations (as in LFG, for example). My proposal is therefore that we get rid of [u-dep/nsubjpass](), [u-dep/csubjpass](), and [u-dep/auxpass]() and instead treat all valency-changing operations as derivations (which we have agreed to do for Turkish causatives, for example). If we want to capture the grammatically regular shifts in valency, we can do so (optionally) in the enhanced dependencies. For example:
<div id="s1a" class="sd-parse">
The cat chased the dog .
nsubj(chased, cat)
dobj(chased, dog)
</div>
<div id="s1b" class="sd-parse">
The dog was chased by the cat .
nsubj(chased, dog)
nmod(chased, cat)
dobj:prom(chased, dog)
nsubj:dem(chased, cat)
</div>
<div id="s1c" class="sd-parse">
The dog was chased from the room .
nsubj(chased, dog)
dobj:prom(chased, dog)
nmod(chased, room)
</div>
I am unsure what relations should be used for the "deep" relations, so I just put "dobj:prom" (for "promoted dobj") and "nsubj:dem" (for "demoted nsubj" for now). Similarly, causatives could be treated like this (Japanese example, copied from WALS online):
<div id="s2" class="sd-parse">
Kanako ga Ziroo o ikaseta . \n Kanako made Ziro go .
nsubj(ikaseta, Kanako)
dobj(ikaseta, Ziroo)
nsubj:dem(ikaseta, Ziroo)
</div>
An alternative approach would be to make [u-dep/nsubjpass]() a language-specific subtype (thus, "nsubj:pass"). In this way, treebanks that don't make this distinction (and I think we have a significant number) would be legitimate, and languages that don't have a passive wouldn't have to worry about it. Languages that have a grammaticalized causative could conceivable add "dobj:caus", etc. This is in many ways a simpler solution, but I am afraid we would be overloading the language-specific relations with too many distinctions.
