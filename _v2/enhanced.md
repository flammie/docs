# Enhanced Dependencies in UD v2

Having a first version of the guidelines for enhanced dependencies is important not just for its own sake,
but also because it has implications for the basic dependencies. Basically, if we know that something
can be captured in the enhanced dependencies, we donâ€™t need to clutter the basic dependencies with
this information. Examples of constructions that can benefit from this are control verbs and light verb
constructions. In this connection, it would also be relevant to discuss what language-specific subtypes can and cannot be used for. We seem to have a lot of inconsistencies here. Report from Uppsala meeting: [future](../2015-08-23-uppsala/future.html).
