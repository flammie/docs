### Description

Boolean feature, typically of pronouns or determiners. It tells whether the
word is reflexive, i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.  This is a lexical
feature in UD and should not be used for e.g. reflexive inflection of verbs
that is common some Uralic languages that we haven't annotated yet.

### `Yes`: is reflexive
