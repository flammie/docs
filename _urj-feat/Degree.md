### Description

Degree of comparison is a feature of adjectives, some adverbs, and verbs in 
participle form. Comparative suffixes can sometimes be used with common nouns
as well. Typically there are three degrees of comparison: positive or first,
comparative or second and superlative or third degree. Some descriptions
include exaggerative degrees, e.g. [hu] _legeslegjobb_ "better than best", 
however it is commonly treated as derivation, compounding or just separate
lexemes and appears typically in very limited situations.

### `Pos`: Positive or first degree

Positive degree is the neutral, typically unmarked form.

#### Positive examples

* [fi] _kaunis_ "pretty", _nopeasti_ "fast", _kauas_ "far"

### `Cmp`: Comparative or second degree

Comparative is used for comparison or comparable qualities.

#### Comparative examples

* [fi] _kauniimpi_ "prettier", _nopeammin_ "faster", _kauemmas_ "further"
* [fi] _ranta_ (noun) "a beach", _rannemmas_ "further towards / into a beach"

### `Sup`: Superlative or third degree

Superlative is used for ultimate within compared group quality.

#### Superlative examples

* [fi] _kaunein_ "prettiest", _nopeimmin_ (or _nopeiten_) "fastest", _kauimmas_ 
  "furthest"
