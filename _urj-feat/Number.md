Number is a feature of nouns, pronouns and numbers as well as of verbs and
adjectives that mark agreement with them.
Number is a common morphological feature. It is used for both number of
nominals and number in verbal inflection. Number in Uralic languages can
typically appear multiple times as a layered feature, e.g. in possession as
number of nominals and number of possessors. For layered features, see
`Number[psor]` and `Number[psed]`.
