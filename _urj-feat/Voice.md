### Description

For most Uralic languages, voice means mainly the active-passive distinction.
Voice is a main feature of verb. The Uralic impersonal are marked as passive
voice and other forms as active. Infinite verb forms that are not clearly either
should not have a voice feature.

### `Act`: Active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object is
affected by the action (patient).

#### Active examples

* [fi] _juoksen_ "I run", _kuuleva_ "hearing"

### `Pass`: Passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer (agent)
is either unexpressed or it appears as an object of the verb.

#### Passive examples

* [fi] _jossain <b>juostaan</b>_ "<b>running</b> is going on somewhere",
  _n√§hty_ "that has been <b>seen</b>"
