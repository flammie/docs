Pronouns are classified in smaller categories using PronType feature.
There's a large number of sub-classes of pronouns in the literature etc.

Pro-words that are not nouns are not classified as PRON part of speech and
subsequently do not use PronType feature either. Proadverbs are just classified
as ADV and pro-adjectives as ADJ.
