<small>
This is the online documentation for Universal
Dependencies, version 1 (2014-10-01).  We intend to treat version 1 as
stable for at least the next year, but we may subsequently make
further revisions based on experiences using it to treebank a range of
languages. If you plan to use the scheme yourself, please get in touch
so that we can avoid problems with conflicting versions.
